# Virtual Classroom Interface
### Please Refer To The Attached Video for demo. (Demo Video.mp4)
## Overview
The virtual classroom interface is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for students who are already registered in the system. The interface consists of key components such as a Navbar, Sidebar, Video Player, and additional features like a Camera and Profile option. The design decisions were guided by the need for simplicity, ease of use, and efficient navigation within the virtual classroom environment.

## Design Decisions

### Layout Structure

**Navbar at the Top:** Placed at the top for easy access to primary navigation options like Classroom, Whiteboard, and Videos. It's a familiar pattern that users expect in web applications.

**Sidebar on the Left:** Contains secondary options like Menu, Notifications, Task Completed, and Profile. The sidebar format allows for quick toggling between these features without cluttering the main interface.

**Video Player on the Right:** Occupying the right half of the screen below the navbar, this layout ensures that the video content is the primary focus for the user. The placement respects the conventional reading pattern (left to right) and thus feels intuitive.

### Interactive Components

**Camera and Microphone Buttons:** Positioned at the bottom left, these are easily accessible for quick actions like turning on/off the camera or mic. Their positioning at the bottom avoids interference with the main content.

**Profile Option at the Sidebar's Bottom:** Ensures constant access to the user's profile without distracting from the learning content. Placed at the bottom to signify its importance as a personal space within the application.

### Styling and Aesthetics

**Consistent Color Scheme and Typography:** Ensures a cohesive look and feel that's easy on the eyes, enhancing user concentration and minimizing distractions.

## Assumptions

**Student Registration:** Itâ€™s assumed that the user (student) is already registered and logged into the system. This allows for a personalized experience, displaying relevant content and notifications.

## Accessibility and Usability

**Simple Navigation:** Prioritized to make it easy for students to find and access various features and resources.

**Clear Visual Cues:** Icons and buttons are designed to be easily recognizable, with tooltips where necessary to aid understanding.

**Keyboard Navigable:** Ensures accessibility for users who rely on keyboard navigation.

## Future Enhancements

**Interactive Whiteboard Integration:** Further integration with features like a whiteboard would enhance the learning experience.

**Chat and Collaboration Tools:** Implementing a chat feature and other collaboration tools would facilitate better communication between students and instructors.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
